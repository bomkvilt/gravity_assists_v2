# gravity_assists_v2
reinvention of the previous gravity-assists (that was a part of a graduate work)

* load all the required submodules
  ```sh
  git submodule update
  ```

* Create all requred profile files for all required cmake kits (if the profiles are missing):
  * profiles are located in `~/.conan2/profiles/<profile name>` files

  * `default` profile can be created with the command
    ```sh
    conan profile detect --force
    ```

  * real profile example (`~/.conan2/profiles/Clang 17.0.6 x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`):
    ```ini
    [settings]
    arch=x86_64
    compiler=clang          # change to see possible variants; {gcc; clang; ...}
    compiler.version=17     # clang++17
    compiler.libcxx=libc++  # use clang's c++ std library (support of c++{20, 23} features)
    build_type=Release
    os=Linux

    [conf]
    # by default conan uses c++ compiler regardless on the `compiler=clang` line above
    # NOTE: single line expression
    tools.build:compiler_executables={'c': '/usr/bin/clang-17', 'cpp': '/usr/bin/clang++-17'}
    ```

* Install a task runner extension (e.g. (Task Runner)[<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=forbeslindesay.forbeslindesay-taskrunner>]).
  * run `conan-01: install` (The step will build specfied conan packages)
  * run `configure` (The step will initialize all the cmake stuff and configure the project)
  * run `build`
